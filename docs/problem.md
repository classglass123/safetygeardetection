# Problem & Motivation

The goal of this project was to identify whether workers were wearing safety gear in the worksite. 
This is important for workplace safety monitoring, reducing accidents, and improving compliance. 
I collected images with and without safety gear and used them to train two deep learning models, AlexNet, and ResNet.
